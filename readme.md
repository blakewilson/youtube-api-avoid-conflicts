# YT API Avoid Conflicts

YT API Avoid Conflicts adds a piece of JavaScript code to the bottom of your WordPress site and finds all instances of window.onYouTubePlayerAPIReady and combines them.

Since the YouTube API requires you to use the function window.onYouTubePlayerAPIReady, there are bound to be conflicts with multiple plugins/themes that utilize the YouTube API. This quick and easy plugin will combine all of these calls into one window.onYouTubePlayerAPIReady call.
